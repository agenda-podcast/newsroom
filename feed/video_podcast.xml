<description>We discuss the 2025–2026 North American winter, a season defined by a weak La Niña pattern and frequent extreme weather events.

<title>Why NYC Rejected Record Safety for Socialism</title>
<description>In 2025 New York City elections, highlighting the historic victory of Zohran Mamdani, the city&apos;s first democratic socialist Muslim mayor.

<title>Failure of Legalization and the Rise of Disorder</title>
<description>The push for legalization has resulted in a chaotic landscape where illegal operators thrive at the expense of public safety. Under the Democratic leadership, the city has been forced to shut down over 1,300 illegal smoke shops that were unlawfully selling cannabis, often targeting children. Despite these efforts, drug offenses remain a stubborn outlier in crime statistics; while other categories reportedly declined, drug offenses actually increased by 7% in 2025. This &quot;atmosphere of anything[snip]</description>

<title>Cooking the Books on NYC Crime: Arrest Avoidance as Statistical Strategy</title>
<description>The phenomenon of &quot;arrest avoidance&quot; to protect statistics. In high-stakes precincts, officers may be discouraged from making arrests that could lead to a spike in reported crime or that would require extensive &quot;bag of shit&quot; paperwork and supervision. The &quot;fake reports&quot; and &quot;lack of reports&quot; described by the rank-and-file are not merely administrative errors; they are the output of a system designed to prioritize the appearance of public safety over the reality of justice. The &quot;impotence&quot; of [snip]</description>

<title>New York City - Market of Bodies: Prostitution crisis</title>
<description>For many newly arrived migrants, sex work is not a choice of profession but a &quot;mechanism of survival&quot; necessitated by the high cost of urban living and the inadequacies of the city&apos;s shelter system. This phenomenon, often termed &quot;survival sex,&quot; has led to &quot;corner fights&quot; between established sex workers and newcomers as territory on Roosevelt Avenue becomes increasingly overcrowded. Organizations like Colectivo report that the stress of the migration journey, combined with the lack of social s[snip]</description>
